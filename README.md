# FoodDecisionApp
Since me and my friends are indecisive people, I decided to make an app that would choose a food style randomly and uses Yelp's API to sugggest the best rated restaurants for the chosen food style to the user. I also integrated Google Location API to track the user's current location to provide the closest restaurant. 

The main screen of this app shows the available food categories, and once the user presses the button, it will randomly choose a food category and calls Yelp API endpoints to display the best-matched restaurants near the user.
